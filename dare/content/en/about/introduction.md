The **DaRe** (Dataset Repository) serves as a dedicated hub for documenting and showcasing the transformation of single-model datasets into various multi-model representations. DaRe is designed to provide researchers, developers, and enthusiasts with a detailed record of our dataset processing journey, from initial raw states to the generated multi-model data.

Each dataset in this repository features a comprehensive record of its original form, including key attributes, structural information, and specific use cases. Furthermore, DaRe offers a look into the transformation process and of curse the results of multi-model data generation.

### MM-cat

DaRe has been created as part of the [MM-cat framework](https://github.com/mmcatdb/mmcat) - a platform-independent conceptual modelling tool to seamlessly model, combine, query, migrate, and evolve data across multiple database models and systems. The multi-model data generation process has been integrated into MM-cat using the Inference functionality, and MM-cat provides it via a guided workflow. 

For those interested in exploring our approach, you are warmly invited to try out the MM-cat tool and its inference capabilities.
