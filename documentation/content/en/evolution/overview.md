Therefore, we need not only a schema modelling tool, but also a way how to evolve the schema so it can keep up with the development of the application This part of the documentation describes how evolution management works in the MM-evocat framework.

The evolution algorithms are currently beying implemented and documented so it is not available yet. Nevertheless, if you are interested in the theory of our approach, you will find it in the following thesis: <a href="/mmcat-docs/doc/evolution_management_in_multi-model_databases.pdf" target="_blank">Evolution Management in Multi-Model Databases</a>.
