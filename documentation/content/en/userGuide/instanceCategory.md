Here you can find the instance category. In the beginning, it's empty but whenever a Model-to-Category job is executed, the imported data is added to it. Remember that the instance category isn't persisted in the backend database, so it exists only as long as the session is valid.

You can click on any object and see to see its active domain. It's displayed as a table. Each row corresponds to one active domain row while each column represents one attribute from the object's superid. Each attribute is marked with the label of the respective instance object and identified by the signature of the morphism that leads to this object.
