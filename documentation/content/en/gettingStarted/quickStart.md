### Theory

The framework is based on some interesting theoretical concepts. It's impossible to utilize all its functionalities without understanding the concepts first. A brief introduction to the theoretical background can be found [here](../theoreticalBackground/overview.md).

### Usage

The framework currently consists of a frontend application, a backend application and some java libraries. Please start by reading the [User Guide](../userGuide/overview.md). Then you should try the demo of the [Application](http://nosql.ms.mff.cuni.cz/mmcat/).

### Development

If you are interested in the development of the framework, its codebase is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/contosp/evolution-management). There you can also find all the necessary information how to build and deploy both applications. Don't forget to read the [Project Documentation](../projectDocumentation/overview.md).

### Documentation

This documentation was created by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Geekdocs](https://geekdocs.de/) theme. Its codebase is also on [GitLab](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/bartikj3/mmcat-docs/).
