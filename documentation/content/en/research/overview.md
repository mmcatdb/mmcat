Here you can find research projects contributing to the MM-cat framework. If you want to participate in such project, see the [available ones](available.md).

### Technical specification

Most projects are of technical nature, i.e., developing new features, integrating existing tools to the framework, or improving the framework's performance. Therefore, it is recommended to use the same technologies as the framework itself. That means Java on backend and TypeScript with Vue (soon to be React) on frontend. For more details about the technologies and architecture, see the [project documentation](project-documentation/overview.md) or visit the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mmcatdb/mmcat).

*If you have no experience with Java or TypeScript, don't worry. Most contributors didn't have any prior exprience with them either.*
