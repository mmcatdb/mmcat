title: "Design and implementation of a user interface for a multi-model data application"
---

The MM-cat framework consists of various tools that allow users to work with multi-model data. Since the tools were created gradually (mainly as prototypes for proof of concept), no emphasis was placed on the implementation of a suitable user interface. Therefore, the user interface is not friendly nor uniform.

The goal of this project is the analysis of the requirements for working with the mentioned tools, the design and implementation of a uniform and maintainable user interface for the given set of tools. The result of the work should be the design and implementation of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, while both prototypes will be gradually tested on a selected sample of real users.
