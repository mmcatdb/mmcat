title: "Adminer for Multi-Model Data"
---

The goal of the project is to extend the functionality of the MM-cat tool by browsing, displaying and editing data from various database systems (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j). The result should be a user-friendly tool that allows the user (for each database system):
- Get basic information about the system.
- List the tables (or collections, nodes, ...), indexes, etc.
- Clearly display and easily edit data from specific tables (collections ...).
- Run queries in the system-specific language.

Furthemore, the tool should support traversal between entities across different database systems (e.g., a row in PostgreSQL containing an identifier of a document in MongoDB).

**This project is currently available.**
