title: "Infrastructure for Multi-Model Data Management Tool"
---

Modern web applications usually include consepts like "organization", "user", and "project" to manage access to resources. The goal of this project is to design and implement a module for such within the MM-cat framework. It should allow us to:
- Manage access to resources (projects, databases, job runners, etc.) for different users.
- Dynamically create and configure instances of various databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j).
- Manage the lifecycle of these instances (start, stop, delete, etc.).

The module will consist both of a backend service and a user-friendly frontend GUI.
