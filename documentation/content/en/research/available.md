The folowing topics consist of a project part (mostly implementation) and a thesis part (mostly analysis). It's recommended to do both of them at the same time, because the implementation can be used as a proof-of-concept for the analysis, which, in turn, serves as a motivation for the implementation. However, it's possible to do only one of them if necessary.
